1) Computation load can be imbalanced because he cost to check if a point is in Mandelbrot can differ. Indeed for a point in Mandelbrot MAXITER will be needed whereas less iteration are required for a point which is not in Mandelbrot.


2) A load balancing method could be to assign a row to each thread and put other lines in a stack. When a thread is done with its line it can start to process another line and pop it from the stack. The processing ends when no line remains.
