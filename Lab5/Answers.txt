FIND_MAX
--------

1) 

Timing for size 33554432 :

CPU time 0.104595
GPU time 0.092665


2)
At size 33 554 432 the times are comparable.

From size 67 108 864 we can see that the GPU version is much faster.
 
CPU time 0.208956
GPU time 0.155476

3)
One way to optimze it could be to use shared memory for each block.




BITONIC SORTING
---------------

1) One half of the threads produce two results (the two values swapped or not) and the other half of threads do not produce a result

2) In one block we can handle up to 2048 items (if all the 1024 threads produce the result)

3) we cannot syncrhonize the threads of different blocks. To solve this we stopped and re-launche another kernel

4) 

for 1024x1024 = 1048576 items we have a very interesting speedup (around 10 times faster)
CPU : 1.248912
GPU : 0.127522


The break even point is between 32768 and 65536 items. (we only tested power of 2 numbers)
**** for 32768 items :
CPU : 0.049026
GPU : 0.063220

**** for 65536 items :
CPU : 0.096656
GPU : 0.055700



A parallelized version on the cpu could give better performance than the sequential verion. But it is sure that it would not be better than the gpu version.
