Question: How is the communication between the host and the graphic card handled?

The comunication is done with buffers
1) create the buffer on the gpu and fill them with the data (clCreateBuffer)
2) pass the buffers as arguments to the kernel


Question: What function executes your kernel?

The following function executes the kernel : 
	clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(commands, kernel, 1, NULL, &global, &local, 0, NULL, NULL);


Question: How does the kernel know what element to work on?

Pointers to the buffers are passed as arguments and each thread can get its id with get_global_id().

QUESTION: How much data did you put in local (shared memory?

(16 + 2*KERNELSIZE)Â² *3


QUESTION: How much data does each thread copy to local memory?
	
each thread copies 4 *3 data to local memory. (only the pixels too close to the border do not copy data)


QUESTION: How did you handle the necessary overlap between the work groups?

the local memory contains the overlap.


QUESTION: If we would like to increase the block size, about how big work groups would be safe to use in this case? Why?

the size of the image has to be divisible by the size of the work groupds.

QUESTION: How much speedup did you get over the naive version?

	KERNELSIZE = 5

Naive version : time 0.003633
Optimized version :  time 0.002149
