The comunication is done with buffers
1) create the buffer on the gpu and fill them with the data (clCreateBuffer)
2) pass the buffers as arguments to the kernel


Question: What function executes your kernel?

The following function executes the kernel : 
	clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(commands, kernel, 1, NULL, &global, &local, 0, NULL, NULL);

Pointers to the buffers are passed as arguments and each thread can get its id with get_global_id().
